My project is a pizza ordering system, in which you can choose from a variety of pizza, and order it straight to your front door. 
So far I have all of the main layout coded aswell as most of the buttons and different places to input text. 
My major problem I have been facing is getting everything to fit all on one screen without it getting cut off. 
My next step is to finish up the coding and make it look aesthetically pleasing.
